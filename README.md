This is my final project for CS50P and first project overall.
It is a journaling app made using PyQt6 containg all basic functionalities of saving, editing, deleting and creating of files.
Other functionalities include a custom dark theme for better visibility and dynamically changing font size when splitter is moved and a visible date.

Every entry is stored as a text file in a folder of "entries" made besides the pyjournal.py file automatically.

It uses "PyQt6", "sys", "os" and "datetime" as imports and has a custom made icon made through Canva.

Future updates might include a search function in the list and export as pdf or word files buttons if I ever get around to it.
